* Test this qt5 version properly

  - currently compiles, builds and runs OK on my machine (nick)

* Make matix components pretty

  - proper group buttons, better adjust buttons...
    I can't remember the key bindings, how can I expect the
    casual user to?

* Check validity under the following circumstances:

  - Removing all inputs and/or outputs (may segfault?)
  - (Seems OK now?)
