JackMix is a matrix mixer allowing p input channels to be mixed into
q output channles by a matrix of faders. It relies on the Jack framework
to route these inputs and outputs.

There's a video about Nick using jackmix at [https://vimeo.com/75655401]

This version of jackmix is enhanced for compatibility with an external
MIDI control surface and compiles for qt5.
